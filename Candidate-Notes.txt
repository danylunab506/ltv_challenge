- This challenge was tested on physical iOS and Android devices 

- An API Key is required to load Google maps. My personal api key is used for that. I decided to keep it on the project in order to make easier 
the review process. 
You can find the Api Key on:
*api_constants.dart (googleMapsApiKey)
*AndroidManifest.xml
*AppDelegate.swift

- I decided to implment the search address through LocationIQ API because Google service asked me an payment method.
- To implement LocationIQ we need an API Key as well.I decided to keep it on the project in order to make easier 
the review process. 
You can find the Api Key on: 
*api_constants.dart (locationIQToken)
